rest: an architectural style
convention for mapping CRUD actions to HTTP requests

why?
easy pattern for structuring a web app.
avoids url chaos
makes apis easier

GET: get me the document at this url. used to request a single resource or multiple resources
POST: create a new resource. URL represents a collection. body is the data
PUT/PATCH: replace(modify) a reousrce at this url
DELETE: destroy a resource at this url

REST implemented
