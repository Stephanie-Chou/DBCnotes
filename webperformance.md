#Web Performance
Make things go FAST

## the importance of performace
+ Speed wins customers
+ Speed means security reliabilty and trust

+ save servers
+ efficiency throughput
+ save machines and developer time
## categories of performance problems
###Network (Bandwith/ Latency)
+ bandwidth: how much data you are sending
	+ Bytes! extra spaces, fields, uncompressed responses and images
+ latency: how long it takes to set up a connection
	+ connections are expensive (network, local, TCP)
	+ secure connections are VERY expensive 
TCP handshake!
###Computation
+ loops take time. a lot of time. don't do heavy stuff in a loop (api calls, db queries etc)
###Resource Utilization
## instance of problems with solutions
